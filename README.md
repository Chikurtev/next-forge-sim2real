## Configuration

### Board Configuration

The developed ROS 2 node can be easily configured with a JSON configuration file. Sample configuration file which is used by the default launch file and startup scripts is stored in [./board_configs/default.json](./board_configs/default.json).

Each configuration file should contain a list of JSON objects for each task board sensor with the following set of name/value pairs:

| name       | value                                                                                                                                                                                                                | sample value           |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `name`     | String with the name of the sensor. It is not supposed to contain any whitespace characters.                                                                                                                         | `"button_A"`           |
| `type`     | String with a ROS 2 type.                                                                                                                                                                                            | `"std_msgs/msg/Int32"` |
| `topic`    | String with a ROS 2 topic.                                                                                                                                                                                           | `"/button/A_status"`   |
| `initial`  | The initial value of the sensor.                                                                                                                                                                                     | `-1`                   |
| `deadzone` | Integer which defines the dead zone of the sensor. Useful for analog sensors like potentiometers to limit the amount of transmitted data. If this value is set to `0` any new data from the sensor will be recorded. | `50`                   |
| `timeout`  | Integer which defines the sampling time of the sensor in ms. If this value is set to `0` any new data from the sensor will be recorded without any timeout.                                                          | `10000`                |

## Launch

The complete automated way to start the task board recorder node for the default test board configuration is to `cd` to the `ros2_ws` folder and execute the script [`./scripts/start.bash`](./scripts/start.bash).

The complete automated way to start the task board recorder node for Task Board version 2023 (TBv2023) is to `cd` to the `ros2_ws` folder and execute the script [`./scripts/start_TBv2023.bash`](./scripts/start_TBv2023.bash).

You can play a recording stored in a JSON file by using the `recording_player` node. Sample configuration for the node is stored in the launch file [`./launch/play_test_recording_launch.py`](./launch/play_test_recording_launch.py). The `timeout` parameter sets the seconds for which the start of the recording is delayed. Useful if you need to wait for the loading of the visualization software. You ca run the launch file with the following command `ros2 launch ./launch/play_test_recording_launch.py`. You can also play a recording of the execution of the ROBOTHON_2023 protocol executed on a Task Board version 2023 with the following command `ros2 launch ./launch/play_robothon_2023_recording_launch.py`. For this recording the angle sensor is mounted, so, that it shows 4035 when door is fully closed, 4030 - 0 degrees, 2770 - 90 degrees, 2365 - fully opened. Yon can visualize the recording with `ros2 launch ./launch/display_TBv2023_launch.py`.

You can start the Webots simulation by execution of [`./scripts/run_webots.bash`](./scripts/run_webots.bash) from the `ros2_ws` folder. This open the Webots simulator and start the ROS 2 launch file [`./launch/webots_simulation_launch.py`](./launch/webots_simulation_launch.py). You can also restart the simulation controllers by using the launch file.

If you want to execute only a specific package you can source the ROS 2 environment by execution of [`./scripts/run_ros.bash`](./scripts/run_ros.bash) from the `ros2_ws` folder. Packages can be launched in different configurations. The [./launch](./launch/) directory contains various launch configurations. The complete configuration which also starts a rosbridge WebSocket server can be started with the following command `ros2 launch ./launch/complete_launch.py`.

## Additional packages compilation or rebuild

If you need to compile additional packages the script [`./scripts/build.bash`](./scripts/build.bash) is provided. It will skip packages related to the `micro_ros` and also the `board_recorder_interfaces` package.

The `board_recorder_interfaces` package can be compiled with `colcon build --packages-select board_recorder_interfaces`.

## Actions provided by the task board recorder

There actions for task board manaagement and for recordings control.

### Task board management

The developed packages provide the following action for task board management:
